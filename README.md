In this project, I have used python 3 in my ipynb. In the "Mr. LastOne.ipynb", I have used libraries including pandas, numpy, time, 
datetime, warnings, sklearn and xgboost. In the "Second notebook.ipynb", i have used libraries like tensorflow, keras, math.

How to run it: 
  Open "Mr.LastOne.ipynb", run the cell one by one to the end of the file.
  Open "Second notebook.ipynb", run the cell one by one to the end of the file.

The first result is in "Xgboost final result.csv"

The second result is in "ANN FinalResult.csv"
